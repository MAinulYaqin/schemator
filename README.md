# Schemator

**Schemator 2 is Electron app, not Chrome app anymore.**

Even figure out to fast prototyping Laravel model and migration in one screen instead of create that stuff one by one ?

With Schemator, you can prototype and visualize your own scheme and export to whatever text files format, not just [Laravel model and migration](https://github.com/gattigaga/schemator-laravel).

Schemator is pluggable, so you can create your own plugin to define your field types, how Schemator create relations between tables, and what data should be exported.
