# Schemator

**Schemator 2 is Electron app, not Chrome app anymore.**

Even figure out to fast prototyping Laravel model and migration in one screen instead of create that stuff one by one ?

With Schemator, you can prototype and visualize your own scheme and export to whatever text files format, not just [Laravel model and migration](https://github.com/gattigaga/schemator-laravel).

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Download [here](https://github.com/gattigaga/schemator/releases/tag/1.0.1) (Sorry, I can't pay Chrome Web Store submission fee).
2. Open Extensions page in Google Chrome Browser.
3. Drag and drop to it.
=======
Schemator is pluggable, so you can create your own plugin to define your field types, how Schemator create relations between tables, and what data should be exported.
